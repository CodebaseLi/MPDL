# MPDL---TODO
This repository is an implementation of our NeurIPS 2021 paper (Stylized Dialogue Generation with Multi-Pass Dual Learning) in PyTorch.

## Data
The TCFC dataset can be downloaded from [Stylized_Dialog](https://github.com/silverriver/Stylized_Dialog). Our constructed SDGC dataset is composed of three parts, the un-styled dialogue paris (TCFC), and the style transfer data [Shakespeare](https://aclanthology.org/C12-1177.pdf), and annotated test set (the directory *SDGC*).
